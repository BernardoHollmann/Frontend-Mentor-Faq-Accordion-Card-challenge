## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | FAQ Accordion Card challenge
  - The challenge consisted in replicating FAQ accordion card component for a desktop and mobile view perspective.
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS + Javascript
  - I have to say that this one required A LOT of work to complete. At first, I created a grid a and separated the images from the FAQ questions. I know the image placing of this challenge was going to be something else, as the woman and the box were like floating in the screen. It took me some hours and research to figure out how to organize these images in the grid. I had to basically use try and error with the position, transform and overflow attributes to pull this off. It was not easy, but I think the result is satisfactory. The other part of this project that kept my busy for A LOT of time was the Javascript one. I knew I had to iterate from the elements in order to change its classes, so the answers could be hidden or shown up as clicked. However, I didn't know how to change parent/child nodes from the DOM attributes. I confess that I had to look for the solution online, from another user, in order to adapt his code to mine. At least I learned how to use this technique so I can implement it in the future. For last, but not least, I had to make it responsive for mobile users. This was also challenging, but I think the result is ok. I don't really know how to put the shadow below the main image and I left the design as is.
